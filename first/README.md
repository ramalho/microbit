# First-experience demo program

## Questions

- How do I reset the micro:bit to factory defaults?

- How do I reload the initial program onto the micro:bit?

- Where can I find the first experience hex file?

- How do I get back to the game that is pre-loaded on the micro:bit

- Where is the demo program that comes pre-loaded on the micro:bit?


## Answer

Just download the .hex file in this directory, plug your micro:bit into your computer with a USB cable, and drag and drop it onto the MICROBIT drive that appears on your computer. This will load the original code back into your micro:bit.


## Additional information

The source code program for this first-experience hex file was written in C++. We are checking with the program authors what the copyright situation is on this program, and hope to make the source code available for download at some point in the future.


## Warning

If you use this .hex file and wish to use bluetooth services on iOS phones with version 10 of the OS or later, the Bluetooth pairing does not quite work correctly. The resolution for this is to create a simple program in the pxt.microbit.org editor and flash that over USB to the micro:bit first, and then bluetooth pairing will work again on iOS 10 and above.
